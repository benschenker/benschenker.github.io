        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a seasoned software engineer with a strong background in Elixir,
          PostgreSQL, React, and Python. Over the past several years, I've led
          and contributed to various projects, including scaling systems and
          improving performance in both startup and large-scale environments. I
          love working on projects that are actually used in the real world.

        <h2>When I'm Not Working</h2>

        <h3>Dungeons & Dragons</h3>
        <p>
          I've been playing Dungeons & Dragons for 2+ years and have enjoyed
          playing in a few campaigns (RIP Daisy Devilson, the Best Tiefling Bard
          there ever was). I love getting lost in the story and finding clever
          ways to solve problems.
        </p>
        <h3>Sourdough</h3>
        <p>
          I've been baking sourdough bread on and off since 2018. I find the
          process of making sourdough to be both meditative and rewarding, and I
          love sharing my loaves with friends and family. I am on a quest for
          the easiest and tastiest 100% whole wheat sourdough recipe.
        </p>
        <h3>Spanish</h3>
        <p>
          I've been studying Spanish on and off for the past few years and have
          enjoyed immersing myself in the language. I have had success with in

        </p>
        <h3>Mentorship</h3>
        <p>
          I've been a volunteer mentor since 2015. I've mentored students at my
          alma mater, Cooper Union, and have also coached some other early
          career software engineers. I find mentorship to be a rewarding outlet,
          finding that providing external accountability can help my mentees to
          achieve their goals.

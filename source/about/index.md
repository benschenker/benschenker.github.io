I am a software engineer at [Landdox](http://landdox.com/) in New York focusing on web development with Javascript and Elixir.

I am a regular volunteer with [The Star Learning Center](https://www.goddard.org/grcc/programs/ChildrenYouth/star/) tutoring public school students in math.

I occasionally blog over at [Silicon Spatula](http://siliconspatula.com/) with my old friend [@davidleshaw](https://twitter.com/DavidLeshaw) about tech and food.
